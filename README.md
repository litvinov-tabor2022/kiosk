Part of the _Br√°ny Skeldalu_ summer camp game.

This is a self-handled kiosk project, a colleague of the [Portal](https://github.com/litvinov-tabor2022/portal-main).

What's interesting from technology PoV is the usage of DWIN HMI display.

See [Portal Framework](https://github.com/litvinov-tabor2022/esp32-portal-framework) for more info.
